# Swift Coding Challenges

Prepare of iOS interviews, test yourself against friends, and level up your skills.

This repository contains my solutions for coding challenges from the book: **[Swift Coding Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/swift-coding-challenges)** by *[Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws)*

## What's in the book?

Swift Coding Challenges contains 64 challenges across five categories and three difficulty levels, so there's something for everyone. Here are some sample challenges that are covered:

- Given two strings, write a function that returns true if all letters are unique.
- Make a version of the min() method that returns the three smallest numbers in an array.
- Write an implementation of quick sort for arrays.
- Recreate the built-in map() method for collections.
- Write a function that returns the frequency of a word in an input file.
- Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board, write a function that returns true if either player has won the game.
- Write a function that accepts a binary tree and returns true if it's balanced.
- Given a string with no duplicate characters, write a function that returns an array containing all letter permutations.
- Write a function that accepts an integer array and returns its median value.
- Write a function that accepts a linked list that loops back to itself, and returns the item at the start of the loop.
